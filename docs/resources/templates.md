# Templates
{: .no_toc .fw-700 }

We have a growing collection of templates at our disposal for use across different aspects of projects. As with our toolset, these templates arenâ€™t set in stone, they are a great starting point for research methodologies, sample templates, design systems, and more. We will continue to update this section with more templates as they become more solidified in our practice.

## Research and workshops

**[ðŸ”’ Discovery & Framing Method Cards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1If_bLbRyn4H8FmvIr7eBYKtu4AXcQ_Rj/view)** - Weâ€™ve created a set of method cards that outline possible Discovery and Framing activities. Each method provides the what, why, and when to use as well as a detailed explanation of the process for running it.

**[ðŸ”’ New project kickoff](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kt0cswE=/)** - This Miro board contains a growing number of activities that you can use during the kick off or inception of a new project.

**[ðŸ”’ Usability recruitment email template](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qh4Ny2DRjsvrNLSx_GXZoOJkMXcUnmAv)** - Sample usability recruitment emails provided by [usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/). There are templates for recruitment as well as confirmation of both in person and remote sessions.

**[ðŸ”’ Usability findings template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vXfdELAda8Vhg58G0wLZb4f2oXoFzQFKbe6JibRSoaQ/edit#slide=id.g4c4243ba87_0_414)** - A sample usability finding template that outlines scope, synthesis, findings, and solutions exploration.

**[ðŸ”’ Usability script template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJ_DR_Zrho1cYNQRaMlkQ9Tz8aroVHy9Kci9-2898Z0/edit#heading=h.4uoggmftr6zl)** - A sample usability script template that outlines goals, flow, introductions, session setup, tasks, and follow up.

## Design systems

**USWDS templates/docs** - USWDS is our first stop in choosing components, typography, color palettes, and layouts for federal technology projects. The design system is built and maintained by GSA and is usually a requirement for many of our government contracts.

- **[Documentation](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** - This USWDS site provides resources and documentation for each part of the design system. We also have a dedicated Slack channel [ðŸ”’ #g-uswds](https://trussworks.slack.com/archives/C0122MPMXL3) for questions or comments on working with the system on Truss projects.

- **[Figma library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/836611771720754351/U.S.-Web-Design-System-(USWDS)-Component-library)** - For designers using Figma for UI design weâ€™ve created a USWDS Figma component library. Some light documentation on how to use it can be found in this [blog post](https://truss.works/blog/uswds-figma-library).

- **[Sketch and Adobe XD libraries](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/designers/)** - GSA officially maintains template libraries for Sketch and Adobe XD which can be found on their documentation site.
