# Team charter and practice
{: .fw-700 }

## Our purpose
We help organizations succeed by identifying the right thing to build and then building it right—in that order. We advocate for the user and create experiences that are inclusive, accessible, responsive and backed by research. Work doesn’t end when the product is delivered; we are dedicated to teaching our processes and empowering our clients to continue good design practices inside their teams after we’ve gone.

## Our principles

**We are:**  
Curious and collaborative  
Mindful of failures without glamorizing them  
Driven by craft, not tools  
Focused on adding value, not features  
Always learning  

**Our process is:**  
Human centered  
Iterative  
Informed by data, but driven by values and impact  
Accessible and inclusive  
Rooted in the belief that good UX is good business  
Comprehensive, including research, interaction, content, and structure  

## Capabilities

**Discovery and framing:** Researching to identify and validate problems with end users, collaborative workshopping, hypothesis generation and testing, prototyping and validation, MVP definition.

**Iterative design and validation:** Interaction, content and visual design based on research and data. Continuous testing with end users to validate and evolve our work to respond to emerging conditions.

**Transformation:** Teaching clients how to identify and validate assumptions and make good decisions; teaching clients how to work with designers.

## Superpowers
As a team, we produce stronger work by combining our diverse skills, perspectives, and backgrounds. We have experience across multiple industries, from government and large enterprise companies to tech startups.

We’re as comfortable with complex legacy systems as we are with a blank page, and have experience building in agile environments with tight iteration. We have a track record of building strong relationships and using design and research to make projects successful.
