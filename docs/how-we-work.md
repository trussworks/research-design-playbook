# How we work
{: .no_toc .fw-700 }

As designers at Truss, we have a wealth of opportunities to both learn and deepen our expertise of good design practices, as well as teach and share these practices to fellow Trussels and our clients.

## Sharing with and learning from our design teammates

More brains are better than one, so we take every opportunity possible to share with and learn from other designers on our team. Here are some of the ways that unfolds:

**Weekly huddles**  
We meet for an hour every week to talk through team developments or trainings, share work, or run a workshop together. Notes from past huddles can always be found in üîí[this shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PJLiesGhCTqUlT0mrg6PC9scS2SocV4hL98YJtscU0A/edit#heading=h.fmqjp8bk9qys).

**Being humans time**  
Every week, there is an optional 30 minutes on the calendar to get together with fellow designers and talk about not-work-related things. Because we don‚Äôt catch one another in the hallway or by the watercooler, this time is there to help us form those human-to-human connections necessary to do good work together. This is something we do [at the company-level](https://guide.truss.works/#meeting-being-humans-together-bht) and occasionally at the project-level, too. Anyone is welcome to throw out a topic (üîí[see this list for ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiOphvQlVfHHxhujq_pTEHMA1Ef2JZnpZq0Hm8tttQM/edit)), but be forewarned that with this group, there‚Äôs probably a 50% chance it will end up being food-related.

**Critiques and share-outs**  
We regularly share in-progress work for feedback and to learn from one another. Sometimes these are more formal critiques, and sometimes they‚Äôre just to share something interesting that might be useful to others. Past sessions that we‚Äôve recorded can be found below:

## Bringing design perspective to Truss committees, guilds, and working groups

Truss has a number of üîí[auxiliary groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwQ3N9Zzy0O_KmprdwtAovEwZDGT3TeCdr9rggzu-zI/edit?ts=5d44d762#heading=h.8oxflvtts2qi) where you can lend your time and expertise to help improve the organization. You can easily find these groups by searching ‚Äúc-‚Äù for committees, ‚Äúg-‚Äù for guilds, and ‚Äúwg-‚Äù for working groups in Slack.

Here are some examples of the committees, guilds, and working groups designers have joined or contributed to in the past:

**[#c-compensation](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=c-compensation)**: Kaleigh took on a year-long stint with this group which is responsible for the company‚Äôs quarterly compensation adjustment process.

**[#c-welcoming](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=c-welcoming)**: Liz and Monica have both taken on rotations in this committee which is responsible for helping onboard new Trussels and ensure they have support from a ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù in their practice during their first few months.

**[#g-frontend](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=g-frontend)**: Josh, James, Shauna and others from the design practice have participated in this guild which provides a collaborative space to learn and discuss best frontend development practices.

**[#g-research](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=g-research)**: Carmen started this guild which is focused on deepening research skills, sharing best practices, and building research skills across practices.

**[#wg-covidwriting](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=wg-covidwriting)**: Ryan B and Kate both jumped in to help on a short-term project to formalize and publish our best practices on distributed work.

## Representing design in sales scopings and proposals

We are fortunate to have a business development team that prioritizes practitioner participation and input in the sales process. All scoping calls with prospective commercial clients include a member of the design team so that we can ensure someone from the practice can vet the opportunity, understand the needs of the client, help determine staffing, and assist with writing the proposal.

Monica helped our business development team design a more üîí[streamlined user flow](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kxMVVlU=/) that details every client and internal touchpoint from the prospect stage to getting the deal signed. The üîí[Involving Trussels in CommSales Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1353rTQtvgDz__FDffN2KTHT58R1DN_qKNo9vtU2ixTI/edit#) outlines exactly when designers get brought into the sales process, what the expectations are, and the current list of folks who are designated to assist with this effort.

We‚Äôve also developed a üîí[design-specific scoping guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t00vZ-tBQM0dsop8EoUX7qZAnqzdFbpe93z58uqe3uQ/edit#heading=h.bc9uhdtcwc33) that details what makes a good project and what questions we should be asking the client in the scoping call to ensure it‚Äôs a good fit.

## Designing with teammates and clients on projects

There is no ‚Äútypical‚Äù project here at Truss, so there is no ‚Äútypical‚Äù design playbook to run one, but there are some practices we hold near and dear, which we‚Äôve started to formalize below:

**Team norming**  
Every new project is a new problem to solve and potentially a brand new mix of people to solve it with ‚Äî which is why we care so deeply about team norming and building a foundation of trust. üîí[Here are some of our favorite activities](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kt0cswE=/?moveToWidget=3074457347688302246&cot=13) to get to know each other, understand working styles, and norm on how we‚Äôll work together.

- **BICEPS:** Understand what is important to each person working on the project and what motivates us.
- **Superpowers and kryptonite:** Understand each person‚Äôs self-identified strengths and areas for growth/improvement.
- **Contribute, lead, learn:** Understand the work areas each person wants to contribute to, lead, and learn more about.

We‚Äôve also found it helpful, as an output from these activities, to develop more 	üîí[formal workstreams](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kt0cswE=/?moveToWidget=3074457347687556976&cot=13) for everyone on the team that detail what they‚Äôre 
responsible for leading, who they will collaborate with, and any potential risks.

In addition to these activities, it is also critically important to discuss with the 
entire internal team how decisions will be made, who will be involved, and how 
they will be documented. Truss has a robust practice of using [decision records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) 
to document decisions ‚Äî which the üîí[SABER design team adopted](https://github.com/trussworks/saber-research-design/wiki/Design-and-product-decision-records) and 
recommends for future projects.

**Discovery and framing**  
We regularly push clients to include a Discovery and Framing period at the start of each project to ensure we are all aligned on user needs, business goals, and stakeholder priorities before we settle on a solution. If there is a common thread in almost all of our projects, it‚Äôs this, and as designers, we‚Äôre often leading the charge on this effort. 

We think of D&F as a three-phased approach:

1. Understand the problem space
    - Onboard to D&F mindset
    - Align on access and tooling
    - Have a pre-mortem and talk through anti-goals
    - Review past research and identify assumptions and gaps
    - Map current workflows
    - Map stakeholders and their scale of influence  

2. Conduct stakeholder and user research
    - Write interview scripts
    - Recruit, schedule, and conduct interviews
    - Synthesize information (create/update user archetypes, user needs, pain points, journey maps, service blueprints, etc)
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize needs and create experiments roadmap to test ideas

3. Experiment with potential solutions
    - Run design studio sessions with stakeholders and users
    - Design low-fidelity prototypes to test with stakeholders and users
    - Synthesize findings and share recommendations
    - Create an outcome-based roadmap and project plan to move forward

While every project approaches this work a little bit differently, there‚Äôs value in having a shared library of resources to pull from. While it‚Äôs still in progress, we have the beginnings of a üîí[Project Kickoff Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kt0cswE=/?moveToWidget=3074457347687556824&cot=13) with easy-to-copy templates for many of the activities listed above. Additional [resources](../resources/resources) can be found in the Resources section of this playbook.

## Sharing good design practices company-wide

In the life cycle of Truss, research and design is a relatively new practice, so when an opportunity presents itself to share design practices and work with the entire company, we take it. 

Every Friday after our practitioner (full company) meeting, there is a 25 minute slot open for any Trussel to present on a topic to the rest of the Truss team. Below is a list of recordings of past One Topic Talks done by members of the design team:

- **üîí[Introduction to content strategy ](https://drive.google.com/a/truss.works/file/d/12I-VKBBqUeLHIBrgIiNk0jBGQqrBNYfg/view?usp=sharing)**
