## Introduction

### The purpose of this site:

Within Truss we have a wealth of opinions and experiences regarding design, research, and content strategy best practices, tools, approaches, and practices. The problems and choices that we encounter in our day-to-day practice are rarely new. Having a straightforward way of applying the things we collectively know to the problems we face would be a source of great efficiency for us and also a boon to the design and research communities.

This collection of resources is intended to be simple and searchable, each one containing the essence of Truss opinions. Whilst any Trussel is free to edit these documents, there is some expectation that these are to be ultimately owned and curated by the members of the design practice at Truss. To that end, proposed changes should be submitted via a pull request and leads will be identified to act as curators for particular knowledge areas.
