# Welcome to the Truss Research-Design Playbook

## Purpose of this Playbook:

Within Truss we have a wealth of opinions and experiences regarding design, research, and content strategy best practices, tools, approaches, and practices. The problems and choices that we encounter in our day-to-day practice are rarely new. Having a straightforward way of applying the things we collectively know to the problems we face would be a source of great efficiency for us and also a boon to the design and research communities.

This collection of resources is intended to be simple and searchable, each one containing the essence of Truss opinions. Whilst any Trussel is free to edit these documents, there is some expectation that these are to be ultimately owned and curated by the members of the design practice at Truss. To that end, proposed changes should be submitted via a pull request and leads will be identified to act as curators for particular knowledge areas.

## Playbook How-To:

If you're not familiar with markdown syntax, check out the handy dandy guide labeled 'markdowncheatsheet.md' in the main directory folder.

**To modify, update, or remove files:**
1. Use a text editor like Sublime Text or Brackets to make the edits you desire and terminal to pull and then push any new changes.
2. Login and use the GitHub interface to make edits and pull requests.

## Setting up the site on your local machine:

**How to set up a local jekyll ruby environment:**
1. Open terminal.
2. Open your browser and go to https://github.com/monfresh/laptop
3. Return to terminal and enter the first command you see in the readme of that directory: 
>bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monfresh/laptop/master/laptop)
4. Allow the script to install. This may take a few minutes, which is fine.
5. Enter a few y’s or n’s and enter  your iOS password. (More detail to come here...)
6. Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.
7. Then, using term, navigate to directory where you are storing your local working files (using cd to move into a directory, and ls to view files inside of a directory).
8. Copy and paste this command, then hit enter:
>bundle exec jekyll serve
9. Open http://localhost:4000 on your browser and you should see the site. Refresh after you’ve changed files to view your updates locally.

Woohoo! Great job! If you run into any trouble or have questions, please reach out to Mariesa (design) or Moncef (engineering).
