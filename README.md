# Welcome to the Truss Research-Design Playbook

## Purpose of this Playbook:

Within Truss we have a wealth of opinions and experiences regarding design, research, and content strategy best practices, tools, approaches, and practices. The problems and choices that we encounter in our day-to-day practice are rarely new. Having a straightforward way of applying the things we collectively know to the problems we face would be a source of great efficiency for us and also a boon to the design and research communities.

This collection of resources is intended to be simple and searchable, each one containing the essence of Truss opinions. Whilst any Trussel is free to edit these documents, there is some expectation that these are to be ultimately owned and curated by the members of the design practice at Truss. To that end, proposed changes should be submitted via a pull request and leads will be identified to act as curators for particular knowledge areas.

## Playbook How-To:

If you're not familiar with markdown syntax, check out the handy dandy guide labeled 'markdowncheatsheet.md' in the main directory folder.

**To modify, update, or remove files:**
1. Use a text editor like Sublime Text or Brackets to make the edits you desire and terminal to pull and then push any new changes.
2. Login and use the GitHub interface to make edits and pull requests.

## Setting up the site on your local machine:

**Install bundler (if you don't already have it)**
- Check to see if you've already got bundler installed using `bunder -v`
- If you don't already have bundler run `gem install bundler`

**Install Jekyll**
- Install Jekyll with `gem install jekyll`

**Get it up and running!**
- Clone this project `git clone git@github.com:trussworks/research-design-playbook.git`
- Navigate into the project folder
- Run `bundle install` to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to get your local environment running
- Check out the site at `localhost:4000`

Woohoo! Great job! If you run into any trouble or have questions, please reach out to Mariesa (design) or Moncef (engineering).
